This started as a project at FHICT in Eindhoven for commit040 to create a Timing System for freerunners.

The version in this repository is to be as simple as can be!

# Status

At the moment there is no difference between the buttons: a click is a click!

## Button

The code for the button can be found in dir 'ESP_3rd_gen'. Created with Aruino IDE. The site is built

## Server

A very simple (web)server is being built in Seaside for Pharo. 

## Issues still working on

+ The site does not refresh automatically at the moment.
+ The buttons need to sync time!
